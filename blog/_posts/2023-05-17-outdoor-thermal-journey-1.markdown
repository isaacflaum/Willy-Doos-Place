This is the first in a series of posts I will be making where I take my thermal camera into nature to literally view the world from a new lens - that is a thermal lens! Our eyes can only see a small frequency range of light - what if we could see more? This is what I hope to achieve in these series of posts.

Thermal Cameras work by converting photons in the 20THz-40THz range (which are heavily influenced by an object's temperature) into an image. These photons, vibrating at 20THz-40THz range, are well outside the range human eyes can detect but with amazing scientific breakthroughs we are able to capture this range of photons and convert it into an image we can view as humans. Since human eyes see Red through Violet the only way we can `see` thermal light is to convert it into visible light for our eyes. There is no one `right` way to convert photons from the 20THz-40THz range to the 400THz-800THz range and thus there are many common `color palettes` used to view thermal images. See the link directly below for a few examples.

[Thermal Color Palettes](https://www.flir.com/discover/industrial/picking-a-thermal-color-palette/)

For my images I mostly use FLIR's low-contrast Ironbow palette making it easy to distinguish hot and cold colors, as well as the high-contrast Rainbow palette which is useful for visualizing small changes in temperature or gradients. Without further ado, here is the first photo dump from my walk through Cape Elizabeth's Greenbelt System.

Even mundane outdoor photos contain a wealth of information in the thermal spectrum. The second and third thermal photos look like they are straight out of Alice in Wonderland! What I find most interesting is the 10-15 degree difference between the various parts of the ground, underbrush, shrubs and trees. Below are some more observations.

### Tree leaves are warmer than the surrounding air, but not warmer than the trunk

### Boardwalk retains heat well

### Different plants on the ground retain heat differently

### The Water in Maine is still very cold - 47 degrees!

### Last but certainly not least, Willy Doo!

That concludes my first photo journey, thanks for taking it with me!
